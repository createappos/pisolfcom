                <h2>Why This Website Was Made</h2>
                <p>
                    This website was born from a simple need: a centralized, clean, and efficient place to manage software projects and document code. We wanted to move beyond scattered notes and complex tools to create a streamlined hub for developers and teams. PISOLF is designed to be a straightforward solution for tracking progress, sharing code snippets, and keeping everything organized in one place.

                <h2>How It Was Built</h2>
                <p>
                    PISOLF is built with modern, fundamental web technologies. The front-end uses clean, semantic HTML, styled with responsive CSS for a great experience on any device. All interactive features, like the code uploader and mobile navigation, are powered by lightweight, vanilla JavaScript. This approach ensures the site is fast, easy to maintain, and accessible to everyone without relying on heavy frameworks.
